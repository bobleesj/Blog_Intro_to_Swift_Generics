## Personal Story (You may skip)
As I was writing a blog post on Functional Programming in Swift, I realized readers must have a strong foundation in Generics and Protocols to survive through.

To find out if there were any good resources about generics, I clicked every link on the first 5 pages of the google search. After having gone through a couple, I’ve come to a conclusion that I had to do something about it — I felt the urgency to stand up for my readers. I could imagine their struggle and pain I went through.

### Prerequisites
*In order to fully enjoy this article with me, make sure you are familiar with protocols, OOP, functions, and extensions. If not, you may find all of the required resources available here which is my personal learning journey.*

*Since we are talking about generics, I’m going to use generic examples from the Swift 3 documentation. Of course, my explanation isn’t generic.*

## Your Past
Before we talk about anything else, let’s look into your past. How you were taught and brainwashed. Imagine you need to print each element within an array, you probably did this.
